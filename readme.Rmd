Kiryl Varanovich  

The repository contains all the materials I used to pass the course. Course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning  
Scripts:

* `quiz1.R`
* `quiz2.R`
* `quiz3.R`
* `quiz4.R`

Show the code I used to pass the quizes.

Folder Project contains the following files:

* `readme.md` - explains how the processing was done;
* `codebook.md` - describes the final dataset;
* `run_analysis.R` - the main script that does the whole processing. It is fully
automated, which means it creates all folders and downloads necessary libraries;
* `data/summary_activity_data.txt` - summarized statistics (mean) grouped by
**activity**;
* `data/summary_id_data.txt` - summarized statistics (mean) grouped by subject
**id**;
